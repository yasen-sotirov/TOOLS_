Description
We will build a small console dictionary in order to practice writing and importing Python modules.
The dictionary will support the following functionality: - adding a new word to the dictionary - updating existing word's meaning - searching for a word in the dictionary
1. Console Dictionary Module
    must be in a separate file, for example console_dictionary.py
    must store words along with their meaning
        you can keep the word in a two-dimensional list; example: python dictionary = [ ['word', 'meaning of the word'], ['hello', 'hello is a common greeting'], ['bye', 'bye is not a common greeting'] ]
    must define the following functions:
        add_word(word, meaning) - creates a new entry in the dictionary
        update_meaning(word, meaning) - replaces the word in the dictionary with a new meaning
        find_word(word) - returns the meaning of the word or None, if no such word

2. Instruction Runner Module
    file: instruction_runner.py
    must import the functions defined in the console-dictionary module
    must define a function execute_instruction(line), handling several possible instructions
        parse the input and execute one of the possible console-dictionary functions:
        add:word:meaning for word - uses the add_word imported function
            returns Added word msg
        update:word:new meaning for word - uses the update_meaning imported function
            returns Meaning updated msg
        find:keyword - uses the find_word imported function
            returns No such word or word: "meaning of word" message

3. Main module
    file: main.py
    imports the instruction_runner module
    reads input until it reaches the exit instruction
    passes the line to the function defined by the instruction_runner module
"""


import instruction_runner
import console_distionary as cd


while True:
    data = input().split(":")
    if data[0] == 'exit':
        print()
        print("Dictionary content")
        for el in cd.console_dictionary:
            print(el)
        print('The program finished')
        break
    else:
        instruction_runner.execute_instructions(data)

"""
Sample input

add:keyword:word with special meaning in a language
add:while:keyword that repeats code
update:while:keyword that repeats code until condition is true
find:keyword
find:while
find:for
exit

Sample output

Added word
Added word
Meaning updated
keyword: "word with special meaning in a language"
while: "keyword that repeats code until condition is true"
No such word
