## OOP Workshop - Car Dealership

The Car Dealership already has a working Engine. **You do not have to touch anything in it.** Just use it. 

There are three types of vehicles in the Car Dealership for now, **Car**, **Motorcycle** and **Truck**.
Each of the vehicles has **make**, **model**, **wheels count** and **price**.

- The **Car** type has **seats**
- The **Motorcycle** type has a **category**
- The **Truck** type has a **weight capacity**

There are users in the Vehicle Dealership as well.

- The users can **GetVehicle**, **AddVehicle**, **RemoveVehicle**, **AddComment** and **RemoveComment**
- Every user has collection of **Vehicles** and every **Vehicle** in this collection has collection of **Comments**.
- Users should **register** and **login** before doing anything in the Car Dealership. If a user is not logged or there is another user logged in he cannot do anything. This is already implemented and you are not expected to do anything here (but you can still figure out how it works :) ).

### Design the classes

Your task is to design an object-oriented system to model a Car Dealership. Avoid duplicated code though abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism and encapsulate correctly all attributes.

***

## IMPORTANT
IF YOU ARE UNSURE WHAT METHODS/ATTRIBUTES TO IMPLEMENT IN THE UNFINISHED CLASSES, **LOOK AT THE UNIT TESTS** 

***

### Validation

**The error messages and all the constraints for each attribute that must be validated can be *found in the example output*. 
If you are unsure about some constraints, run the tests.You already have the error messages in the proper classes.**

- Vehicle validation
  - Make and model length.
  - Price range
  - Wheels count
  - Seats count (for car)
  - Category length (for motorcycle)
  - Weight capacity (for truck)

- Motorcycle wheels are **always 2**
- Car wheels are **always 4**
- Truck wheels are **always 8**

- Comment validation
  - Content

- User Validation
  - Username, FirstName, LastName and Password lengths

**All properties in the above classes are mandatory (cannot be empty).**

### User Properties

  - username - length [2:20], only letters and/or digits
  - firstname - length [2:20]
  - lastname - length [2:20]
  - password - length [5:30], can contain only letters, digits, and the special symbols `@, *, -, _`
  - user_role - one of `Admin, Normal, VIP`
  - is_admin -> bool
  - vehicles - list 


### User actions

- Get vehicle by index
  - Returns reference to the vehicle at the specified index
  - Error if invalid index

- Adding a vehicle
  - If the user is admin he cannot add a vehicle
  - If the user is not VIP he cannot add more than 5 vehicles

- Adding a comment 
  - Create a comment for the vehicle and add it to the vehicle's comments

- Remove a vehicle 
  - Just remove the vehicle from the list

- Remove a comment
  - If the author of the comment is not the current user he cannot remove it

### Printing

- For the User class

`Username: {Username}, FullName: {FirstName} {LastName}, Role: {Role}`

- For all vehicles of the user

```none
--USER {Username}--
1. {Vehicle type}:
  Make: {Make}
  Model: {Model}
  Wheels: {Wheels}
  Price: ${Price}
  Category/Weight capacity/Seats: {Category/Weight capacity/Seats}
  --COMMENTS--
  ----------
  {Content}
  User: {Comment Username}
  ----------
  ----------
  {Content}
  User: {Comment username}
  ----------
  --COMMENTS--
2. {Vehicle type}:
  Make: {Make}
  Model: {Model}
  Wheels: {Wheels}
  Price: ${Price}
  Category/Weight capacity/Seats: {Category/Weight capacity/Seats}
  --NO COMMENTS--
```

- **The dashes separating the comments are exactly 10.**
- **Price has `$` in front of the value and is rounded to two digits after the decimal point** *(e.g. `Price: $10000.00`)*

*Hint - one approach to achieve such formatting:*

```python
f'{price:.2f}'
```

- **The weight capacity has `t` after the value** *(e.g. `Weight capacity: 40t`)*
- **Look into the example below to get better understanding of the printing format.**

#### Additional Notes

To simplify your work you are given an already built execution engine that executes a sequence of commands read from the console using the classes and interfaces in your project.

You should implement the empty classes. You can add new classes where needed and modify any of the existing code under the **models** package if necessary.

Currently, the engine supports the following commands:

- **RegisterUser** **(username, firstName, lastName, password, role)** - registers user, if there is no such user already
- **Login** **(username, password)** - logs in user if there is no already logged in and there is such registered user
- **Logout** - logs out the current logged in user
- **AddVehicle** **(type, make, model, price, [category/seats/weightCapacity])** - adds a vehicle to the current user. The fourth parameter depends on the type of the vehicle
- **RemoveVehicle** **(vehicleIndex)** - remove the vehicle on that index if there is such
- **AddComment** **(content, author, vehicleIndex)** - add a comment with the content provided to the vehicle with that index and sets the author
- **RemoveComment** **(vehicleIndex, commentIndex, username)** - removes the comment from the vehicle
- **ShowVehicles** **(username)** - shows all the vehicles of the user

Commands that you should implement yourself:
- **ShowUsers** - shows all the users registered.

**All commands return appropriate success messages. In case of invalid operation or error, the engine returns appropriate error messages.**

### Step by step guide

**1.** Look at the unit tests to get an idea of the required functionality for each class

**2.** Implement the classes in which there is a TODO.
- Try to understand which classes depend on which and start with those without dependencis
- e.g. - the User class requires Comment class for some of its functionality
- go to the unit tests to consult how the methods/attributes should be named

**3.** Validate all properties according to the guidelines set above.

**4.** Implement printing.

- Instead of a `print()` method, you need to override `__str__` in order to output the classes in the console.

**5.** Finish with the ShowUsersCommand 
- check the other commands to see how they are done
