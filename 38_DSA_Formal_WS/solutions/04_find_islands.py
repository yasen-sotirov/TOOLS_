Small World

Small World is fun board game about conquering the world by different
fantasy races. Each race is defined by two interlocking tiles,
one giving a noun describing the race (e.g., "Elves") and the other
an adjective (e.g., "Flying"), describing an additional special ability
or special scoring opportunity.

One of the skills defines that you can move and conquer only fields
from same type (lawn, mountain, lakes) that are next to each other.
On each turn the player with this race wants to take as many fields
as possible.

Given a matrix of 1s (fields from one type that is allowed currently f
or the user) and 0s (other fields), calculate the size of each conquest.

    –ê conquest is formed when each field is connected to another from
    same type either vertically or horizontally.
    The size of a conquest is the number of conquered fields in it.

Input
Read from the standard input:

    Line 1 - N M - dimensions of the matrix that represents the game board.
    Next N lines - each of the rows in it.

Output
Print to the standard output:

    Sizes of the conquests must be sorted in descending order.
    Print each conquest's size on a new line.

    Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 20
