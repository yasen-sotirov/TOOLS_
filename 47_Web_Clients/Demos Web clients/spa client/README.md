Example Single page application that uses the server API

### Disclaimer
This code is written using native JS with imperative DOM manipulations, and is therefore too complex. In a real environment use a technology such as [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [something similar](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA).

### Usage
Start the project by running `python -m http.server 8001` from a terminal at this folder (where the `index.html` file is located.)
