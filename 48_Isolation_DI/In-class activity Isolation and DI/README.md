# Ordering App

_Part 7_

### 1. Description
The Ordering app is ready for testing!

### 2. Goals  
- Practice unit testing using isolation and DI
- Practice working with Mock

### 3. Tasks for today:
- Write as many **good** unit tests as you can
- Start with the project in the Demo folder
- Write unit tests for at least one service and one router (preferably, the service should be the `order_service` as the functionality inside is most suitable for unit testing)

### 4. Setup
1. Turn off mariadb.
